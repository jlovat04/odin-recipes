    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Calabacitas is a savory vegetarian dish. It is eaten in many places. Where I am from in New Mexico it is eaten year round but the best time is in the Summer when Zuchini and Squash start to produce. As well as corn.</p>
    
    <p>It is usually made with fresh ingredients as this is where it gets most of its flavor from. Fresh Squash/zuchini, corn, tomatoes, and onions.</p>
